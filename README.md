# Personal Website written in Next.js Source Code

This repository contains the source code for my personal website https://vadimgierko.com developed by myself from scratch at first in React & then adapted/ rewritten in Next.js.

*Note: the website is currently offline, because of hosting provider changes. But you can check out its working **React version** copy deployed via Github Pages [here](https://vadimgierko.github.io/personal-website-react) or try **Next.js** version copy deployed via Vercel by clicking the link in the About section (description) of the repository.*

## History: From *Website System* through *React* to *Next.js*

Previously (from September 2020 to October 2022) my personal website was built with [Website System](https://github.com/PiotrWnuczek/WebsiteSystem) developed by [Piotr Wnuczek](https://github.com/piotrwnuczek). I was using *Website System*, because I didn't code at that time & my friend Piotr designed, developed & helped me to start my blog & website with his excellent solution.

It worked fine, but I've started to learn web-development since then (from December 2020) & decided to rebuild the site & develop it from scratch by myself. So I've developed the website in React at first (see [website](https://vadimgierko.github.io/personal-website-react) or [see the code](https://github.com/vadimgierko/personal-website-react)).

Then I've learned basics of Next.js & rewrote the React website version using Next.js to serve the site statically & provide best SEO. The Next.js version of the site will be hosted via new hosting provider soonly at my custom domain https://vadimgierko.com.
