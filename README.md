# Personal Website Source Code

This repository contains the source code for my personal website https://vadimgierko.com developed by myself from scratch at first in React & then adapted/ rewritten in Next.js.

Previously (from September 2020 to October 2022) my personal website was built with [Website System](https://github.com/PiotrWnuczek/WebsiteSystem) developed by [Piotr Wnuczek](https://github.com/piotrwnuczek). I was using *Website System*, because I didn't code at that time & my friend Piotr designed, developed & helped me to start my blog & website with his excellent solution.

It worked fine, but I've started to learn web-development since then & decided to rebuild the site & develop it from scratch by myself.
I've developed the website in React at first. Then I've learned basics of Next.js & rewrote the React code to Next.js
