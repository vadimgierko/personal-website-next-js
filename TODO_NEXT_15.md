- check & update metadata
  - see [TODO](/TODO.md#seo)
  - canonical where needed
- check why formsubmit throws server error 500 or that this is spam, but the mail is in formsubmit dashboard anyway
- migrate to TS completely + refactor everything (structure, folders, components)
- check how to build all SSR pages static & is it better then SSR?
