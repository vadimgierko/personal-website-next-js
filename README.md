# Legacy Version of my Personal Website [vadimgierko.com](https://vadimgierko.com) (*CMS + Website in one repo*)

This branch contains the previous combined codebase where both the CMS and the website frontend were developed together in a single repository.

From September 16 2025 the project has been split into two repositories:

- [headless CMS](https://github.com/vadimgierko/headless-cms-next-js),
- [repository](https://github.com/vadimgierko/vadimgierko.com).

This branch is kept for documentation and reference purposes only and will not receive further updates.

## Legacy Description

The project contains the source code, textual, visual & multimedia content (*I like to share my knowledge & creative works with others*) of my personal website written (re)written in **Next.js**.

## Status

The website is deployed, published & available at https://vadimgierko.com.

I'm constantly working on improving the website, refactoring the code, adding new content, components, pages & features. Each commit (to main branch) & pull request causes redeploying & changes in the appearance & functioning of the website.

So the site you see today might me different from the site available yesterday or tomorrow. Even if I add all the features I want & there will be no changes in the code, I'll still be adding new textual & visual content.

## Project details

### Sitemap

The website contains the following dynamic routes:

- **/** => the **main page**, which contains short bio & maps fields of interests cards
  - **/[field-of-interests]** => (web-development, creative project management, visual thinking, music)
    - **/[field-of-interests]/[items]** => (articles, projects, images, audios, videos)
  - **/[article]** => any article from any field
  - **/[project]** => any project from any field

### Project/website structure/architecture

My website contains a few types of pages:

- **field of interests**, which is generated by `<FieldOfInterests />` component, built from smaller reusable components, such as:
  - `<Section />` layout component, which wraps other components inside for styling
  - `<MarkdownRenderer />` custom component, which wraps `<ReactMarkdown />` component & changing all the internal links into next/links to prevent reloading the website
  - `<IconsList />` for mapping skills icons
  - `<CardsList />` for mapping articles & projects cards
  - `<Gallery />` for mapping images
- **projects**, which maps `<CardsList />` of projects
- **project**, which is generated by `<Project />` component, built from smaller reusable components, such as:
  - `<Section />` layout component, which wraps other components inside for styling
  - `<MarkdownRenderer />` custom component, which wraps `<ReactMarkdown />` component & changing all the internal links into next/links to prevent reloading the website
  - `<IconsList />` for mapping skills icons
- **articles**, which maps `<CardsList />` of articles
- **article**, which is generated by `<Article />` component
- **images** which is generated by `<Gallery />` component

### The content of my website

My personal website contains:

- the overwiew of fields/ areas I'm interested in:
  - [web development](https://vadimgierko.com/web-development) (that's _de facto_ my **developer portfolio**)
  - [creative process management](https://vadimgierko.com/creative-process-management)
  - [visual thinking](https://vadimgierko.com/visual-thinking) (mind maps & visual notes)
  - composing [music](https://vadimgierko.com/music) & classical guitar
- textual, visual & multimedia content I created in the areas mentioned above:
  - projects
  - articles
  - mind maps & visual notes
  - samples of composed music
  - workshops
  - video collaborations/ live talks
  - ebook
  - social media projects/ accounts

## Features & Custom Components

- custom dark/ light mode theme switcher with additional auto detecting if the user prefers dark theme on its device
- RWD (responsive web design applied), so the website looks good on any device
- fully dynamic routing using page type prop to render a proper component
  - no hardcoded pages
  - adding new content requires no coding to create a new page of any predefined type
- all the components are dynamic & reusable =>
  - that's very easy to me to add/ edit/ delete any field of interests, project, article, image, video or audio, because it needs only adding a new content into dedicated folder => no coding is needed!
  - I can easily create new/ extend pages or components using existing building blocks
- [Atomic Design methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) applied to organize reusable components
- custom _Gallery_ component with a modal showing up after clicking an image
- custom _MarkdownRenderer_ to render markdown syntax
  - used to write articles, fields of interests' & projects' descriptions etc.
  - allows to style markdown content using passed custom components or additional styles
- auto fetching my code repositories data (descriptions, urls, README files content) from GitHub to hydrate the website with the current data during the build
