# Personal Website Source Code

This repository contains the source code for my personal website https://vadimgierko.com developed by myself from scratch at first in React & then adapted for Next.js.

At the moment (from 2020 to until I remove this note) the website is built with [Website System](https://github.com/PiotrWnuczek/WebsiteSystem) developed by [Piotr Wnuczek](https://github.com/piotrwnuczek).

I'm currently working on creating a website from scratch in React to migrate from Website the System to my own developed website.
